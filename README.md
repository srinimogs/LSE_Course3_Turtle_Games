week 1: the summary shows shows a picture where the regression model only explains about 45% or less of the model is explained. In the first regression analysis it shows that there is only 45% correlation between amount spent by customers to the loyalty pints they earned. Also the "X" value shows that "y" value which is loyalty pints only change 33% of the spending. The Second analysis shows a similar picture regarding correlation between remuneration of a customer and the loyalty point earned. the F-stat value is lower than the threshold of 0.05 which means there is significance in the variation of the data. the third visual is even worse with all values very low thus showing that there the model is not much effective, and far more cleaning and analysis is required with different set of data and parameters.
