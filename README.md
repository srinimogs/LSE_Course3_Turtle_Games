week 1: the summary shows shows a picture where the regression model only explains about 45% or less of the model is explained. In the first regression analysis it shows that there is only 45% correlation between amount spent by customers to the loyalty pints they earned. Also the "X" value shows that "y" value which is loyalty pints only change 33% of the spending. The Second analysis shows a similar picture regarding correlation between remuneration of a customer and the loyalty point earned. the F-stat value is lower than the threshold of 0.05 which means there is significance in the variation of the data. the third visual is even worse with all values very low thus showing that there the model is not much effective, and far more cleaning and analysis is required with different set of data and parameters. 

Week 4: From the plots created the sales trend is towards Nintendo gaming devices and particularly the DS and Wii, they have clocked sales of over 20 million worldwide with national and european sales also reflecting that trend. The devices made by Microsoft namely the XBox lags behind with fewer thatn 20 million units sold worldwode and is locked in competition with Play Station machines. Although they are doing well but PS and XBox machines are lagging behind and the reason are many fold. they are more complex offer more multiplayer capability and hence require good internet connection and are prone to hacking and outages in the network. Turtle Ganes will have to take all this into cognisance when they make games, perhaps make more for Nintendo devices. Attention should also be shown on the technology as far as Play Station is concerned as the older machines go tou, making games that can be played accross all PS devices is important as that will attract more customers who are cost conscious.
